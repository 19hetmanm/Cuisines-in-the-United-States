<h2> History</h2>
<div><p>It is believed that authentic Mexican food might have been derived from the Mayan Indians, they were nomadic hunters and gatherers. They ate wild game, tropic fruits, and fish; as well as corn tortillas with bean paste. In the 1300â€™s, during The Aztec Empire, chili peppers, honey, salt and chocolate were introduced into the cooking along with their staple foods. Wild game like turkey and duck becomes domesticated during the era. In 1521, when Spain invaded Mexico, Spanish foods had a big influence on the Mexican Cuisine. Livestock like sheep, pigs, and cows were introduced. Different herbs, wheat, spices and dairy products came with the Spanish. Mexican people started to integrate different cuisines like Caribbean, South American, French, West African, and Portuguese. The result of this has made Mexican foods today every diverse and dishes can vary from region to region.
